            <h1>Zakat</h1>
            <p>Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam. It is obligatory on all Muslims (men and women) who possess
                wealth at least equal to ‘Nisab. Zakat is the most important act of lbadah after Salah. It purifies
                assets and creates virtue. The Holy Our’an and the Prophet’s (PBUH) Ahadith warn of severe punishment to
                those who do not pay their Zakat.</p>
            <p class="allah-said">” THE EXAMPLE OF THOSE WHO SPEND THEIR WEALTH IN WAY OF ALLAH IS LIKE SEED OF GRAIN
                WHICH GROWS SEVEN SPIKES; IN EACH SPIKE IS HUNDRED GRAINS. AND ALLAH MULTIPLIES HIS REWARD FOR WHOM HE
                WILL. “
                (THE HOLY QURAN , 2:261)</p>

                    Your Qurbani Makes A Difference.The Qurbani sacrifice (also known as Udhiya or Udhiyah) is an
                    essential part of our Islamic faith. Springing from the prophetic tradition of Ibrahim (on him be
                    peace), it embodies a complete sacrifice for the pleasure of God.
